An augmented-reality WebXR animation of Chopin's "Winter Wind" Ã‰tude to hang on your wall! Works on flat-screen, too.

For the WebXR version, use a Meta Quest 2 or Quest Pro with passthrough turned on and setup your room's walls with the Room Setup configuration tool found in the experimental settings.

## Notes

The "magic" portal uses a stencil buffer and a clip plane. A minimal example can be found at https://playground.babylonjs.com/#A1Z15H#7.

The keyboard model is a modified version from the [Babylon.js Piano tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/javascript/tutorials/babylonjs-webxr-piano/keyboard-interaction-03). A minimal example  can be found at https://playground.babylonjs.com/#Z02BBJ#6.

The MIDI file used in this project was created by Bernd Krueger. It can be found at http://www.piano-midi.de/chopin.htm.
